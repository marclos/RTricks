```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Import CSV to R


```{r cars}
phakelake.csv = "/home/mwl04747/RTricks/02_pHake_Lake/pHake_Lake/pHakeLake.csv"
temp <- read.csv(phakelake.csv)
temp
names(temp)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(Temperature ~ Depth, data = temp)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
