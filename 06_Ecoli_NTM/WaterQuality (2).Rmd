Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a bacterium commonly found in the intestines of humans and animals, where most strains are harmless and play a role in digestion. However, the presence of E. coli in water is a major public health concern, as it serves as an indicator of fecal contamination and the potential presence of harmful pathogens. Certain strains can cause serious illnesses, including diarrhea, urinary tract infections, and even kidney failure. Contaminated water sources—whether from agricultural runoff, sewage leaks, or stormwater overflows—pose risks not only to drinking water supplies but also to recreational waters and agricultural irrigation. Ingestion of water containing pathogenic E. coli can lead to widespread outbreaks, highlighting the importance of routine water quality monitoring and treatment. Effective detection methods, such as the Colilert test, help identify E. coli contamination, allowing for timely interventions to protect public health and prevent the spread of waterborne diseases.

So this week in class we took water samples from three different places across campus - pHake lake, Seal Court (my group) and Pomona Bioswale - to test it for exactly these reasons.

Since the Pr(>F) value (p-value) is less than 0.05 (as it's 0.03), it means that there is statistically significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis for the ANOVA test is that the means of the groups (in this case, the Site_ID locations) are all equal. A p-value less than 0.05 suggests that at least one of the sites has a significantly different mean for the EC_MPN (or TC_MPN) value, implying the locations are not the same with respect to the measured MPN (microbial contamination level).
