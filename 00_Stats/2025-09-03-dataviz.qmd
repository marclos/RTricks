* What was Hilary trying to answer in her data collection?

* Name two of Hilary's main hurdles in gathering accurate data.

* Which is better:  high touch (manual) or low touch (automatic) data collection?  Why?

* What additional covariates are needed / desired?  Any problems with them?

* How much data does she need?

* Are there any ethical considerations to think about?

# Graphics

## Grammar of graphics

Yau (2013) gives us nine visual cues, and Wickham (2014) translates them into a language using `ggplot2`.  

1. Visual Cues:  the aspects of the figure where we should focus.  
**Position** (numerical) where in relation to other things?  
**Length** (numerical) how big (in one dimension)?  
**Angle** (numerical) how wide? parallel to something else?  
**Direction** (numerical) at what slope?  In a time series, going up or down?  
**Shape** (categorical) belonging to what group?  
**Area** (numerical) how big (in two dimensions)?  Beware of improper scaling!  
**Volume** (numerical) how big (in three dimensions)?  Beware of improper scaling!  
**Shade** (either) to what extent?  how severely?  
**Color** (either) to what extent? how severely? Beware of red/green color blindness.  

2. Coordinate System: rectangular, polar, geographic, etc.

3. Scale: numeric (linear? logarithmic?), categorical (ordered?), time

4. Context: in comparison to what (think back to ideas from Tufte)

# Goals of `ggplot2`

What I will try to do

 * give a tour of `ggplot2`
 
 * explain how to think about plots the `ggplot2` way
 
 * prepare/encourage you to learn more later
 
What I can't do in one session

 * show every bell and whistle
 
 * make you an expert at using `ggplot2`
 



## Getting help

1.  One of the best ways to get started with ggplot is to Google what you want to do with the word ggplot.  Then look through the images that come up.  More often than not, the associated code is there.  There are also ggplot galleries of images, one of them is here: https://plot.ly/ggplot2/

2. Look at the end of this presentation and the syllabus.  More help options there.

## The grammar of graphics `ggplot` 
            

**geom**: the geometric "shape" used to display data
 
  * bar, point, line, ribbon, text, etc.
 
**aesthetic**: an attribute controlling how geom is displayed with respect to variables

  * x **position**, y **position**, **color**, fill, shape, size, etc.

<!--
**scale**: adjust information in the aesthetic to map onto the plot

  * *particular* assignment of colors, shapes, sizes, etc.; making axes continuous or constrained to a particular range of values.
-->

**guide**: helps user convert visual data back into raw data (legends, axes)

**stat**: a transformation applied to data before geom gets it

  * example: histograms work on binned data

  labs(title = "US Births in 2015")
```


 *  The layers are placed one on top of the other:  the points 
are *below* and the lines are *above*.   

 * `data` and `aes` specified in `ggplot()` affect all geoms
:::
::::


## What does this code do?
  

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(data = Births2015,
       aes(x = date, y = births, color = "navy")) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "US Births in 2015") 
```


## What does this code do?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(data = Births2015,
       aes(x = date, y = births, color = "navy")) + 
  geom_point()  +
  labs(title = "US Births in 2015")
```


This is *mapping* the color aesthetic to a new variable with 
only one value ("navy").  
So all the dots get set to the same color, but it's not navy.


## Setting vs. Mapping

If we want to *set* the color to be navy for all of the dots, we do 
it outside the `aes()` designation:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2,3"
ggplot(data = Births2015,
       aes(x = date, y = births)) +   # map variables 
  geom_point(color = "navy")    +   # set attributes
  labs(title = "US Births in 2015")
```


* Note that `color = "navy"` is now outside of the aesthetics list.  That's how `ggplot2` distinguishes between mapping and setting.

* `ggplot()` establishes the default data and aesthetics
for the geoms, but each geom may change these defaults.

* good practice: put into `ggplot()` the things that affect all (or most) of the layers; rest in `geom_XXXX()`

## Setting vs. Mapping (again)

Information gets passed to the plot via:

a. `map` the **variable** information inside the aes (aesthetic) command

a. `set` the **non-variable** information outside the aes (aesthetic) command

# Examples in the wild

* Tufte -- Cholera & Challenger
* Fonts
* NYT often does data viz quite well
* W.E.B Du Bois



## Preliminaries

1. Make the data stand out

2. Facilitate comparison

3. Add information

(Nolan & Perrrett, 2016)


## Preliminaries

Tufte lists two main motivational steps to working with graphics as part of an argument.

1. "An essential analytic task in making decisions based on evidence is to understand how things work."

2. Making decisions based on evidence requires the appropriate display of that evidence."

# Tufte

Tufte (1997) <a href = "https://www.edwardtufte.com/book/visual-and-statistical-thinking-displays-of-evidence-for-making-decisions/" target = "_blank">Visual and Statistical Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions</a>.  (Use Google to find it.)


## Cholera - a picture tells 1000 words

```{r fig.cap = "How many aspects of this graph can you point out which are relevant to figuring out that cholera infection was coming from a single pump?  Are there any distracting aspects?", out.width="65%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/cholera1.jpg")
```



## Cholera - difficult to interpret

```{r fig.cap = "Why would the outbreak already have begun to decline before the pump handle was removed?", out.width="80%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/cholera2.jpg")
```


## Challenger - Problematic

```{r fig.cap = "One of the graphics which was particularly unconvincing in trying to explain that O-rings fail in the cold.", out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/challenger2.jpg")
```


## Challenger - Better????

```{r fig.cap = "A different graph of the Challenger information, now sorted by temperature", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/challenger1.jpg")
```


## Challenger - Improved

```{r fig.cap = "The graphic the engineers should have led with in trying to persuade the administrators not to launch.  It is evident that the number of O-ring failures is quite highly associated with the ambient temperature.  Note the *vital* information on the x-axis associated with the large number of launches at warm temperatures that had *zero* O-ring failures.", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/TuftestemperatureandOringrelationshi.jpg")
```

Note that the "improved" Challenger graphic was made by **Tufte**, not by the engineers working on the problem at the time.


## Fonts matter

```{r, out.width = "500px", fig.alt = "image credit: Will Chase RStudio::conf 2020", echo=FALSE,fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/fontsmatter.png")
``` 



## Advice on plotting, specific

- Avoid having other graph elements interfere with data
- Use visually prominent symbols
- Avoid over-plotting  (One way to avoid over plotting: jitter the values)
- Different values of data may obscure each other
- Include all or nearly all of the data
- Fill data region



## Advice on plotting, general

- Eliminate superfluous material
- Facilitate comparisons
- Choose the best scale
- Make the plot data / information rich
- Use good captions, alt text, conclusions




## Simplify

```{r, out.width = "85%", fig.cap = "image credit: https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/portfolio-data-looks-better-naked", fig.alt = "A gif of a barplot which starts out cluttered with labels and slowly becomes simplified with the relevant information highlighted.", echo=FALSE}

## What they did well

* lighter grid lines
* no extra information
* good caption

# W.E.B. Du Bois

One of the great early data viz pioneers. Remarkable ability to convey information.


## Worth a Mention

:::: {.columns} 
::: {.column width="50%"}
W.E.B. Du Bois (1868-1963)

* sociologist

In 1900 Du Bois contributed approximately 60 data visualizations to an exhibit at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, an exhibit designed to illustrate the progress made by African Americans since the end of slavery (only 37 years prior, in 1863).

## Side note: what makes a plot good?
   

Most (all?) graphics are intended to help us make comparisons

* How does something change over time?
* Do my treatments matter?  How much?
* Do treatment and control respond the same way?

Does my plot make the comparisons I am interested in:

binned data.  
`stat_bin()` performs the data transformation.

really choose our own.

```{r, fig.height=1.5}
HELP_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = i1)) + geom_area(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```




## Covariates: Adding in more variables
  

Using color and linetype:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "3,4"
ggplot(data = HELP_data,
       aes(x = i1,
           color = substance,
           linetype = children)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


## Using color and facets

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
ggplot(data = HELP_data,
       aes(x = i1, color = substance)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "density") + 
  facet_grid( . ~ children ) +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
ggplot(data = HELP_data,
       aes(x = i1, color = substance)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "density") + 
  facet_grid( children ~ . ) +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


## Boxplots 
   
Boxplots use `stat_quantile()` (five number summary).

The quantitative variable must be `y`, and there must be an 
additional `x` variable. 

```{r fig.height = 3.5}
HELP_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = substance, y = age, color = children)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```



## Horizontal boxplots
    
Horizontal boxplots  are obtained by flipping the coordinate system:

* `coord_flip()` may be used with other plots as well to reverse the roles
of `x` and `y` on the plot.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
ggplot(data = HELP_data,
       aes(x = substance, 
           y = age, 
           color = children)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


## Axes scaling with boxplots
    
We can scale the continuous axis
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
ggplot(data = HELP_data,
       aes(x = substance, 
           y = age, 
           color = children)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_trans(y = "exp") +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```



## Give me some space
  
We've triggered a new feature: `dodge` (for dodging things left/right).
We can control how much if we set the dodge manually.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
ggplot(data = HELP_data,
       aes(x = substance, 
           y = age, 
           color = children)) + 
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width=1)) +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


## Issues with bigger data

* Although we can see a generally positive association (as we would 
expect), the overplotting may be hiding information.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
library(NHANES)
dim(NHANES)
ggplot(data = NHANES,
       aes(x = Height, y = Weight)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid( Gender ~ PregnantNow )
```


## Using alpha (opacity)

One way to deal with overplotting is to set the opacity low.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
ggplot(data = NHANES,
       aes(x = Height, y = Weight)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.01) + 
  facet_grid( Gender ~ PregnantNow )
```


## geom_density2d
  
Alternatively (or simultaneously) we might prefer a different 
geom altogether.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
ggplot(data = NHANES,
       aes(x = Height, y = Weight)) +
  geom_density2d() + 
  facet_grid( Gender ~ PregnantNow )
```


## Multiple layers

:::: {.columns} 
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2,3"
ggplot(data = HELP_data, 
       aes(x = children, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.size = 0) +
  geom_point(alpha=.6) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
ggplot(data = HELP_data,
       aes(x = children, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.size = 0) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=.6, width = 0.1) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

#| echo: true

#| code-line-numbers: "5"
ggplot(data = HELP_data,

  geom_boxplot(outlier.size = 0) +
  geom_point(alpha=.6, 
             position = position_jitter(width=.1, height=0)) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


## Things I haven't mentioned (much)
 
 * coords (`coord_flip()` is good to know about)
 
 * themes (for customizing appearance)

 * position (`position_dodge()`, `position_jitterdodge()`,
 `position_stack()`, etc.)
 
 * transforming axes
 
## themes 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(Births2015, aes(x = date, y = births)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_wsj()
```




## `jitterdodge()`
 
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
ggplot(data = HELP_data, 
       aes(x = substance, y = age, color = children)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 10, position = position_dodge()) +
  geom_point(aes(color = children, 
                 fill = children), 
             position = position_jitterdodge()) +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```




## A little bit of everything

```{r, fig.width=14}
ggplot(data = HELP_data, aes(x = substance, y = age, color = children)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 10, position = position_dodge(width=1)) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = children), alpha=.5, 
             position = position_jitterdodge(dodge.width=1, jitter.width = 0.2)) + 
  facet_wrap(~homeless) +
  labs(title = "HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```
