## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
NH3_immature <- c()
NH3_mature <- c()
CO2_immature <- c()
CO2_mature <- c()
```

## t.test()

You can also embed plots, for example:

### Free Ammmonia

```{r ttest, echo=FALSE}
t.test(NH3_immature, NH3_mature)
```

### Carbon Dioxide Respiration

```{r ttest, echo=FALSE}
t.test(CO2_immature, CO2_mature)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
