Goal and Justification
The goal is to compare the time it takes for algal cultures under three different treatments to reach a specific growth milestone (an absorbance threshold). We use a survival analysis approach because it correctly handles cultures that never reach the threshold (right-censoring) and provides robust, interpretable comparisons of growth rates over time.

Explanation for Korey and Maria
Survival analysis fits our data perfectly because it focuses on Time-to-Event, not just the final outcome.

Survival Term	Algae Equivalent	Statistical Role
Event	Reaching the chosen OD threshold (e.g., OD = 0.6).	Defines the failure point we are tracking.
Time	Time in hours until OD >= threshold.	The variable we are modeling.
Censoring	Not reaching the threshold by the end of the experiment.	Allows us to keep and use data from slower cultures without bias.
Hazard Ratio	The relative rate of reaching the threshold between two treatments.	Quantifies the speed difference: HR > 1 means faster growth.
